# Design Choices

This document explains the key design choices made in the Weather Comparison Application and the rationale behind them.

## 1. Separation of Concerns

**Choice**: Dividing the application into Controller, Service, and Repository layers.

**Rationale**:
- Improves code organization and readability.
- Enhances maintainability by isolating different functionalities.
- Facilitates easier testing of individual components.
- Allows for easier scalability and feature additions.

## 2. RESTful API Design

**Choice**: Implementing RESTful endpoints for weather comparisons.

**Rationale**:
- Provides a standardized approach to API design.
- Enables easy integration with various front-end technologies.
- Supports scalability and potential future mobile app development.

## 3. Model Design (CityInfo)

**Choice**: Creating a model class that mirrors the JSON structure from the API.

**Rationale**:
- Simplifies deserialization of API responses.
- Provides a clear representation of the data structure.
- Enhances type safety and reduces errors related to data handling.

## 4. External API Integration

**Choice**: Using RestTemplate for API calls to Visual Crossing Weather API.

**Rationale**:
- Built-in support in Spring for making HTTP requests.
- Automatic handling of JSON deserialization.
- Simplifies error handling for API calls.

## 5. Error Handling

**Choice**: Implementing a CustomErrorController and using try-catch blocks in the WeatherController.

**Rationale**:
- Provides user-friendly error messages.
- Centralizes error handling for undefined endpoints.
- Allows for graceful handling of exceptions during weather data processing.

## 6. Testing Strategy

**Choice**: Using JUnit for unit testing and Mockito for mocking dependencies.

**Rationale**:
- JUnit is the standard for Java unit testing.
- Mockito allows for isolation of units under test by mocking dependencies.
- Enables testing of service layer logic without making actual API calls.

## 7. User Interface

**Choice**: Simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the front-end.

**Rationale**:
- Keeps the application lightweight and easy to understand.
- Sufficient for demonstrating the core functionality.
- Easy to replace with a more advanced front-end framework if needed in the future.

## 8. Configuration Management

**Choice**: Using application.properties for configuration.

**Rationale**:
- Standard approach in Spring Boot applications.
- Allows for easy configuration changes without code modifications.
- Supports different configurations for different environments (dev, test, prod).

These design choices aim to create a robust, maintainable, and scalable application while keeping it simple enough for demonstration and educational purposes.
